英语中的语气主要有四种：
* 陈述语气
* 疑问语气
* 祈使语气
* 虚拟语气

虚拟语气就是表示说话人的 **愿望，假设，猜测，或者是建议，而不是表示客观存在的事实**。
它是通过谓语动词的特殊形式来表示的。

## 虚拟语气在条件状语从句中的使用

||条件状语从句|主句|
|-|-|-|
|与**现在**事实相反|If + 主语 + 动词过去式（be动词一律用were）|主语 + would / should + 动词原形|
|与**过去**事实相反|If + 主语 + 动词过去完成时|主语 + would / should + have + 动词过去分词|
|与**将来**事实相反|谓语有以下形式：<br/>（可能性最大）should + 动词原形<br/>（可能性一般）动词过去式<br/>（可能性最小）were to + 动词原形<br/>|主语 + would / should + 动词原型|

注意：主句中的should通常用于第一人称，would可以用于任何人称，同时也可以根据意思，用情态动词could，might等来代替should，would。

例句：
* 与现在事实相反
>If he had time, he would attend the meeting.
If I were you, I should study English.
* 与过去事实相反
> If you had come yesterday, you would have met him.
* 与将来事实相反
> If it (were to)/should rain tomorrow, the meeting would be put off.
If you came tomorrow, we would have the meeting.

#### 虚拟语气的倒装形式

从句省略if，用倒装句式“were, had, should+主语” 如上句型可以转换成下面的形式：
> Should there be a meeting tomorrow, I would come.
Had you been here earlier, you would have seen him.
Were I in school again, I would work harder.

#### 虚拟语气的混合条件句

主句与从句的动作发生在不同的时间，主、从句谓语动词的虚拟语气形式因时间不同而不同，这叫做混合条件句。
混合条件句中，动词的形式要根据它所表示的时间来调整。例如：
> If you had followed the doctor’s advice, you would be all right now.
（从句说的是过去，主句指的是现在，注意，前面举的例子中主从句的时间是相同的）
If you had asked him yesterday, you would know what to do now.
（从句与过去事实相反，主句与现在事实相反。）
If it had rained last night (过去), it would be very cold today (现在).

#### 含蓄条件句的虚拟语气

用连词otherwise, or, but暗示前面的条件，例句如下：
> I thought you would remain there for a while after the conference. Otherwise I wouldn't have bought you a single ticket.
我原本以为你会后要在那逗留一段时间，要不然我就不会给你买单程票了。
It’s lucky we booked a room, or we would have nowhere to stay now.
Mary could be prettier, but she doesn't care much about her clothes.
玛丽本可以更漂亮些，但是她不太在乎衣着。

用介词but for, without表达条件
> But for(要不是) the rain, we should have a pleasant journey.
Without electricity, human life would be quite different today.
如果没有电，人类现在的生活就会是另一个样子了。
The ship would have sunk with all on board but for the efforts of the captain.
要不是因为船长的努力，我们就会连船带人都沉没了。

## 虚拟语气在名词性从句中的使用

主要包括：
* 宾语从句
* 主语从句
* 表语从句
* 同位语从句

#### 虚拟语气用于宾语从句

表示不可能实现的愿望，意思是“可惜...”、“...就好啦”、“ 但愿...”等，用“wish + 宾语从句”。
表示现在不能实现的愿望，从句动词用过去式；
表示过去不能实现的愿望，用“had+过去分词”或者“could/ would +have+过去分词”；
表示将来不可能实现的愿望，用“would/could+动词原形”；
> We wish we had arrived there two hours earlier.
I Wish you could go with us.
I wish it were spring all the year round.

在某些动词后面的宾语从句中，用“(should) + 动词原形”。常用的动词有，一个坚持（insist），两个命令（order，command），三条建议（suggest），四项要求（demand，require，request），具体用法看下面例句：
虚拟语气在动词 arrange, , desire, propose, , ,  等后面的宾语从句中，用“(should) + 动词原形”
> He demanded that we (should) start right away.
The doctor ordered that she (should) stay in bed for a few days.
We suggested that we (should) have a meeting.
注意：insist作“力言”“强调”解时，宾语从句不用虚拟语气，只有当insist作“坚持（应该）”解时，宾语从句才用虚拟语气，例如
We insisted that she (should) go with us.
Mike insisted that he had never stolen anything.

#### 表语从句和同位语从句中的虚拟语气

某些表示“建议”、”计划“、”命令”的名词（如advice, order, demand, plan, proposal, suggestion, request等）后的同位语从句和表语从句中的谓语动词常用“（should）+ 动词原形”
We should consider the students' request that the school library provide more books on popular science.

#### 主语从句中谓语动词通常用“（should）+ 动词原形”

> It is necessary (import, natual, strange, surprising...) that...
It is necessary that he be sent to hospital at once.
It is strange that she should many arch a poor man.

> It is suggested (desired, decided, ordered, requested, proposed...) that...
It has been decided that the meeting be put off till next Saturday.
It is suggested that you spend more time in English.


## 固定句型

1. 虚拟语气用于 “It is (high) time (that) ...”句型中，that从句中的谓语动词用过去式（be用were）或should + 动词原形，should不能省略，意为（现在）该到...的时候了。
> Jack is great talker; It's high time that he did something instead of just talking.
1. 虚拟语气用于would rather后的从句中，用过去式表示现在或将来的情况，用过去完成式表示过去的情况。
> We would rather our daughter stayed at home with us, but it is her choice, and she is not a child any longer.
1. 虚拟语气用于“as if (as though)”, “even if (even though)”等引导的表语从句或状语从句中，对现在的虚拟，用过去式；对过去的虚拟，用过去完成式。
> It was John who broke the window. Why are you talking to me as if I had done it?
1. 虚拟语气用于”if only”引导的感叹句中，其谓语动词的形式与wish后的宾语从句动动词形式一样。
> Look at the trouble I am in! If only I had followed your advice.

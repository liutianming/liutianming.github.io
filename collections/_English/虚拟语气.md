英语中的语气主要有三种，就是我们经常说的陈述语气、祈使语气和虚拟语气。
虚拟语气就是表示说话人的 **愿望，假设，猜测，或者是建议，而不是表示客观存在的事实**。
它是通过谓语动词的特殊形式来表示的。

## 虚拟语气在条件状语从句中的使用

||条件状语从句|主句|
|-|-|-|
|与**现在**事实相反|If + 主语 + 动词过去式（be动词一律用were）|主语 + would / should + 动词原形|
|与**过去**事实相反|If + 主语 + 动词过去完成时|主语 + would / should + have + 动词过去分词|
|与**将来**事实相反|a: 谓语用动词过去式<br/>b: 谓语用 were to + 动词原形<br/>c: 谓语用 should + 动词原形|主语 + would / should + 动词原型|

* 与现在事实相反
>If he had time, he would attend the meeting.
If I were you, I should study English.
* 与过去事实相反
> If you had come yesterday, you would have met him.
* 与将来事实相反
> If it (were to)/should rain tomorrow, the meeting would be put off.
If you came tomorrow, we would have the meeting.

注意：
1. 主句中的should通常用于第一人称
would可以用于任何人称，
同时也可以根据意思，用情态动词could，might等来代替should，would。
1. 从句省略if，用倒装句式“were, had, should+主语” 如上句型可以转换成下面的形式：
> Should there be a meeting tomorrow, I would come.
Had you been here earlier, you would have seen him.
Were I in school again, I would work harder.
1. 混合条件句：当条件状语从句表示的行为和主句表示的行为发生的时间不一致时，动词的形式要根据它所表示的时间来调整。例如：
> If you had followed the doctor’s advice, you would be all right now.（从句说的是过去，主句指的是现在）
1. 用连词otherwise, or, but暗示前面的条件，或者用介词but for, without代替条件状语从句，例句如下：
> It’s lucky we booked a room, or we would have nowhere to stay now.
But for(要不是) the rain, we should have a pleasant journey.

## 虚拟语气在名词性从句中的使用

主要包括宾语从句、主语从句、表语从句、同位语从句。

1. 虚拟语气用于宾语从句，要注意下面特点：
wish + 宾语从句，
表示不可能实现的愿望，意思是“可惜……”、“……就好啦”、“ 但愿……”等。
> We wish we had arrived there two hours earlier.
I Wish you could go with us.
I wish it were spring all the year round.
表示现在不能实现的愿望，从句动词用过去式；
表示过去不能实现的愿望，用“had+过去分词”或者“could/ would +have+过去分词”；
表示将来不可能实现的愿望，用“would/could+动词原形”；

1. 虚拟语气在动词 arrange, command, demand, desire, insist, order, propose, request, require, suggest 等后面的宾语从句中，用“(should) + 动词原形”
> He demanded that we (should) start right away.
The doctor ordered that she (should) stay in bed for a few days.
We suggested that we (should) have a meeting.


1. 在某些动词后面的宾语从句，用“( should )+ 动词原形”常用的动词有，一个坚持，两个命令，三条建议，四项要求，具体用法看下面例句：

1. 表语从句和同位语从句


## 固定句型

1. 虚拟语气用于 “It is (high) time (that) ...”句型中，that从句中的谓语动词用过去式（be用were）或should + 动词原形，should不能省略，意为（现在）该到...的时候了。
> Jack is great talker; It's high time that he did something instead of just talking.
1. 虚拟语气用于would rather后的从句中，用过去式表示现在或将来的情况，用过去完成式表示过去的情况。
> We would rather our daughter stayed at home with us, but it is her choice, and she is not a child any longer.
1. 虚拟语气用于“as if (as though)”, “even if (even though)”等引导的表语从句或状语从句中，对现在的虚拟，用过去式；对过去的虚拟，用过去完成式。
> It was John who broke the window. Why are you talking to me as if I had done it?
1. 虚拟语气用于”if only”引导的感叹句中，其谓语动词的形式与wish后的宾语从句动动词形式一样。
> Look at the trouble I am in! If only I had followed your advice.
